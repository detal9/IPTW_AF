Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator of the attributable fraction

The repository includes a single file for now. This file is an R implementation of an inverse probability
of treatment weighting Kaplan-Meier estimator of the attributable fraction.

The repository will eventually include the code for replicating simulation studies and a SAS macro
implementating the estimator.
